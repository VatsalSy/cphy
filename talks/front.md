# Computational Physics

This book aims to provide a very broad survey of computational methods that are particularly relevant to modern physics research. We will aim to cover efficient algorithm design and performance analysis, traditional numerical recipes such as integration and matrix manipulation, and emerging methods in data analysis and machine learning. Our goal by the end of the class will be to feel comfortable approaching diverse, open-ended computational problems that arise during research, and to be ready to design and share new algorithms with the broader research community.

This book is adapted from the course materials for the Computational Physics course taught by at the University of Texas at Austin. The course website, including runnable notebooks and code for all chapters, can be found online at: [https://github.com/williamgilpin/cphy](https://github.com/williamgilpin/cphy).
