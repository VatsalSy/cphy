# Computational Physics Teaching Project

Create a lecture in the format of the course lectures, which combines an interesting physics problem with teaching an algorithm or technique. For examples, see the [Cellular Automata Lecture](https://www.wgilpin.com/cphy/talks/html_static/inheritance_game_of_life.html), [First Passage Times](https://www.wgilpin.com/cphy/talks/html_static/first_passage_and_inheritance.html), and [Multivariate Optimization.](https://www.wgilpin.com/cphy/talks/html_static/optimization_multivariate.html)


#### Grading
+ Clarity and Interest: 20% 
+ + Contains an interesting topic, and makes a good-faith effort to explain it well.
+ + Creativity: An unexpected application or novel algorithm or interpretation of an algorithm is exciting and appreciated.
+ Code quality: 40%
+ + Logical structure, minimal redundancy
+ + Variables and objects have appropriate scope
+ + Use of appropriate abstractions
+ + Code legibility
+ Documentation: 20%
+ + Notebook is clearly laid-out, and accessible in a standalone format
+ + Code is clearly documented and logical
+ Talk: 20%
+ + Only one group member needs to present, though you are welcome to structure this however you’d like.
+ + These will be ~10 minutes + 2 min questions during the last few sessions of the course (5 talks per class).
+ + Please be ready to present the class session before you are scheduled, just in case someone can’t come on their scheduled presentation day.
+ + You likely won't have time to go through an entire notebook, so focus on showing us how you set up the problem and your code.



#### Ideas for lectures
You can pick anything of interest, here are just some ideas for topics that aren’t currently in the course, but which might be interesting
+ Probabilistic Graphical Models
+ Physics-Informed Neural networks
+ Finite Element Method vs Finish Difference Method
+ Lagrangian Duality in Optimization (A simple demo of this in a physical system would be quite interesting)
+ Q-learning
+ Koopman Operators, eDMD vs DMD
+ Reservoir Computing
+ Krylov Subspace Methods
+ For other ideas, review William Press’s Scientific Computing textbook.
