# Computational Physics Final Project Proposal

1. Select a topic by [coordinating with your group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O16vAUVFH1HswU8cDSWhX64df1tGc6MBhEAng7Doi5Y/edit?usp=sharing). The project rubric, suggested scope, and past examples can be found [on the course website.](https://www.wgilpin.com/cphy/project)

2. Create an empty GitHub repository for your project. If you are new to GitHub, we provide instructions [here](https://www.wgilpin.com/howto/howto_github.html). However, you are free to use a different tooling method, or use the GitHub online GUI, if you prefer.

3. Write a `README.md` file for your project, and commit it to the repository. The README should contain:
    - A brief description of the project.
    - An outline of the project steps, including the main code you plan to write, and your desired results.
    - A brief outline of the planned contributions of each team member. This can be informal, the point of this step is to encourage teams to touch base about their project in advance.

4. Post a link to your project topic, and a link to your GitHub repository [below your group name in the projects roster here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O16vAUVFH1HswU8cDSWhX64df1tGc6MBhEAng7Doi5Y/edit?usp=sharing)
